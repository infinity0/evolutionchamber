a first attempt to implement a builder using evolution chamber in sc2. To use, just run the map file in starcraft.

You are an observer in 1v1 AI fight. Player 1 is build doing our BO.


The BO used is a 16 slings, predicted to run in 4:04. The best AI run did it in about 4:06.

The run generate a log file in sc2 user directory with timings and additional informations.


The whole hack is done in zerg5.galaxy. For now, everything is hardcoded in this file.

More will follow soon (ultimately, an importer/exporter from EC).
